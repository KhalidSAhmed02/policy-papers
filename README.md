##  Overview

This repository contains my research paper titled **"The Role of Tax Policy in Shaping Wealth Distribution"**, which explores how shifts in U.S. tax policy — particularly the decline in progressivity since the late 1970s — have contributed to the modern rise in wealth inequality.

The project highlights the economic feedback loops between labor income, capital returns, and tax structure, and proposes policy solutions drawn from historical and international comparisons.

##  Why I Wrote This

I wrote this paper to bridge theoretical economic models with real-world inequality, combining rigorous research with a values-driven approach to public policy. It reflects my interest in applying data, analysis, and economic reasoning to societal issues like wealth gaps and fiscal fairness.
